<div class="textbox" id="lacing">

    <h1 align="center">Lacing</h1>

    <p>Lacing is most easily done sitting down, holding the rim on edge in your
    lap. People who build wheels all day long start by putting all of the spokes
    into the hub, then connecting them to the rim one after another. This
    approach is slightly faster on a production basis, but the occasional
    builder runs a higher risk of lacing errors this way.</p>

    <p>Non-production wheelbuilders usually put the spokes in one 'group' at a
    time. A conventional wheel has 4 'groups' of spokes: Half of the spokes go
    to the right flange, and half go to the left. On each flange, half are
    'trailing' spokes and half are 'leading' spokes.</p>

</div>


<div id="keyspoke" class="textbox">
<h1 align="center">The 'key' spoke</h1>

<p>The first spoke to be installed is the 'key spoke'.</p>

<p>This spoke must be in the right place or the valve hole will be in the wrong
place, and the drilling of the rim may not match the angles of the spokes. The
key spoke will be a trailing spoke, freewheel side. It is easiest to start with
the trailing spokes, because they are the ones that run along the inside
flanges of the hub. If you start with the leading spokes, it will be more
awkward to install the trailing spokes because the leading spokes will be in
the way.</p>

<p>Since the key spoke is a trailing spoke, it should run along the inside of
the flange. The head of the spoke will be on the outside of the flange.</p>

<p>It is customary to orient the rim so that the label is readable from the
bicycle's right side. If the hub has a label running along the barrel, it
should be located so that it can be read through the valve hole.  These things
will not affect the performance of the wheel, but good wheelbuilders pay
attention to these things as a matter of pride and aesthetics.</p>

<p>Rims are drilled either 'right handed' or 'left handed'. This has to do with
the relationship between the valve hole and the spoke holes. The spoke holes do
not run down the middle of the rim, but are offset alternately from side to
side. The holes on the left side of the rim are for spokes that run to the left
flange of the hub. With some rims, the spoke hole just forward of the valve
hole is offset to the left, with others it is offset to the right (as
illustrated). Which type is 'right handed' and which 'left handed'? I have
never met anyone who was willing to even make a guess!</p>

<p>The key spoke will be next to the valve hole in the rim, or one hole away.</p>

<p>As viewed from the right (sprocket) side of the hub, the key spoke will run
counterclockwise, and it will go to either the hole just to the right of the
valve hole (as illustrated) or the second hole to the right, depending on how
the rim is drilled. The aim is to make the four spokes closest to the valve
hole all angle away from the valve, giving easier access to the valve for
inflation.</p>

<p>Screw a nipple a couple of turns onto the key spoke to hold it in place.
Next, put another spoke through the hub two holes away from the key spoke, so
that there is one empty hole between them on the hub flange. This spoke goes
through the rim 4 holes away from the key spoke, with 3 empty holes in between,
not counting the valve hole.</p>

<p>Continue around the wheel until all <span id="forth">9</span> of the first
group of spokes are in place. Double check that the spacing is even both on the
hub (every other hole should be empty) and the rim (you should have a spoke, 3
empty holes, a spoke, etc. all the way around. Make sure that the spokes are
going through the holes on the same side of the rim as the flange of the hub.
It should look like this:</p>
</div>

<div class="textbox" id="secondgroup">
<h1 align="center">The second group</h1>

<p>Now turn the wheel over and examine the hub. The holes on the left flange do
not line up with the holes on the right flange, but halfway between them. If
you have trouble seeing this, slide a spoke in from the left flange parallel to
the axle, and you will see how it winds up bumping against the right flange
between two spoke holes. Turn the wheel so that the valve hole is at the top of
the wheel. Since you are now looking at the wheel from the non-freewheel side,
the key spoke will be to the left of the valve hole.</p>

<p>If the key spoke is next to the valve hole, insert a spoke into the left
flange so that it lines up just to the left of where the key spoke comes out of
the hub, and run it to the hole in the rim that is just to the left of the key
spoke.</p>

<p>In the illustration, the key spoke is right next to the valve hole. Some
rims are drilled with the opposite 'handedness', so this may not be the case
for your wheel.</p>

<p>If the key spoke is separated from the valve hole by an empty spoke hole,
insert a spoke into the left flange so that it lines up to the right of where
the key spoke comes out of the hub, (looking at the wheel from the left!) and
run this tenth spoke to the hole between the key spoke and the valve hole</p>

<p>If you have done this correctly, the spoke you have just installed will not
cross the key spoke. When you flip the wheel back around so you're looking from
the right side, if the tenth spoke is to the left of the key spoke at the hub,
it will also be to the left of it at the rim. Like the first group of spokes,
it will be a trailing spoke, it will run along the inside of the flange, and
the head will face out from the outside of the flange. Install the other
<span id="forthb">8</span> spokes in this group following the same pattern.</p>

<p>At the end of this stage, the wheel will have all <span id="half">18</span> of
the trailing spokes in place. In the rim, there will be two spokes, two empty
holes, two spokes, two empty holes...etc. as shown below:</p>

</div>

<div class="textbox" id="leadingspokes" >
<h1 align="center">The leading spokes</h1>

<p>Turn the wheel back around so that the freewheel
side is toward you.  Insert a spoke into any hole, but this time from the
inside of the flange.
<span id="crossouta">Twist the hub clockwise as far as it will conveniently go. Since
we are building a cross <span id="crossa">3</span> wheel, this new spoke will
cross <span id="crossb">3</span> trailing spokes that go to the same flange of
the hub.</span></p>

<p><span id="crossoutb">The first <span id="crossd">2</span> crosses, this
spoke will pass outside of the trailing spokes, but for the outermost cross it
should be 'laced' so that it goes on the inside of the last trailing spoke. You
will have to bend this leading spoke to get it around the last trailing spoke
on the correct side.</span></p>

<p><span id="crossoutc">After this leading spoke has crossed <span
id="crossc">3</span> trailing spokes, there will be two possible rim holes to
connect it to. Use the rim hole that is on the same side as the flange you are
working from. It should not be right next to one of the trailing spokes that
runs from the same flange of the hub.</span></p>

<p>Install the other <span id="halfb">17</span> leading spokes following the
same pattern. If you can't get some of the spokes to reach their nipples, make
sure that the nipples on the trailing spokes are seated into their holes. When
you are done, double check around the rim to make sure that every other spoke
goes to the opposite flange of the hub.</p>
